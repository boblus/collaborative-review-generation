This task-oriented approach addresses the 'lost-in-the-middle' syndrome effectively, demonstrating its utility across various QA datasets. Comprehensive ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed structured output format. The study shows that the structured output significantly contributes to the performance improvement of downstream LMs, especially in multi-hop QA tasks. The paper presents a robust methodology by leveraging a single decoder-only LLM for adaptive extraction and restructuring of query-relevant contents. The use of knowledge distillation with multiple teacher models ensures high-quality training data, enhancing the model's ability to maintain context and relatedness information. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the Refiner's architecture and its integration with RAG systems.

        "general_review": "Strengths: The paper presents a novel framework, NeoN, grounded in the principle of the negation of negation, which significantly enhances the comprehensive, reflective, and creative thinking abilities of large language models (LLMs). The introduction of the SJTP dataset is a notable contribution, offering a benchmark for evaluating subjective reasoning capabilities across diverse fields and topics. The paper demonstrates strong technical depth and rigor through comprehensive experimental validation on both subjective and objective tasks, showcasing the practical impact of NeoN in improving reasoning abilities across various models. The results consistently show that NeoN outperforms existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential for broader application.\n\nWeaknesses: 1. The paper could benefit from minor improvements in writing clarity, particularly in the explanation of the NeoN framework and its stages, to aid reader comprehension. 2. Details on hyperparameters and implementation specifics are somewhat limited, which could hinder reproducibility. 3. Some figures could be formatted more clearly to enhance readability and interpretation. 4. The availability of code and data is not explicitly addressed, which could be clarified to facilitate further research and application."

        "aspect_review": "Strengths: The paper introduces a novel task, Integrated Multimodal NER (IMNER), and a unified framework, IMAGE, which breaks the boundaries between text-based, speech, and multimodal NER tasks, showcasing notable novelty and strong technical depth. The authors design a unified data format that effectively integrates text and speech modalities, enabling the model to handle various inputs efficiently, which is a significant practical impact. The experimental results demonstrate that the IMAGE framework achieves competitive performance across TNER, SNER, and MNER tasks, validating its comprehensive experimental validation and transformative potential.\n\nWeaknesses: Some minor details on hyperparameters and implementation are missing, which could slightly hinder reproducibility. The evaluation could benefit from additional baselines for a more comprehensive comparison, although the current results are strong. While the results are impressive, a more detailed analysis of the results could provide deeper insights. The ablation study is informative but could be expanded to explore more components. The comparison with state-of-the-art models is good but could include more recent models. Minor writing improvements could enhance clarity, particularly in the methodology section. The methodology section could benefit from more detailed explanations of certain components, although it is generally well-structured.",

        "aspect_review": "Strengths: The paper introduces a novel method, CushionCache, for mitigating activation outliers in large language models, which is a significant advancement in the field of quantization. The intuition behind using attention sinks to mitigate outliers is well-justified and validated through comprehensive experiments. CushionCache consistently improves the performance of quantized LLMs, achieving substantial gains in zero-shot accuracy, especially in LLaMA models. The method shows significant improvements over existing quantization techniques, such as SmoothQuant, across various scenarios. The paper is well-organized, providing clear explanations of the methodology and thorough experimental results.\n\nWeaknesses: While the motivation is strong, the explanation of the hyperparameter selection could be more detailed. The evaluation is comprehensive, but the impact on encoder-decoder models is not addressed. The focus is primarily on decoder-only models, which limits the generalizability to other architectures. The greedy search process is time-consuming, which could be a limitation for very large models.",
        "general_review": "Strengths: The paper presents a notable novelty in proposing CushionCache, a novel prefix discovery method that effectively mitigates activation outliers in large language models (LLMs), thus enhancing activation quantization performance. The technical depth and rigor are strong, with a well-defined method that includes greedy prefix search and quantization-aware prefix tuning. Comprehensive experimental validation is provided across multiple LLMs, demonstrating significant improvements in quantization performance, particularly in per-tensor static quantization scenarios. The practical impact is significant, as the method offers a hardware-friendly solution that can be seamlessly integrated with existing quantization algorithms, reducing computational costs without extensive retraining.\n\nWeaknesses: 1. Minor writing or clarity improvements could be made in the explanation of the greedy search algorithm and its initialization process. 2. Small details on hyperparameters, such as the choice of the threshold parameter 𝜉, could be further elaborated to aid reproducibility. 3. Very minor formatting on figures, such as ensuring consistent labeling and clarity in graphs, would enhance readability. 4. Slight clarification on code availability and whether it will be released for public use would be beneficial for the community."
